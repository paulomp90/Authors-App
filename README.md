# BeersApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8, for UI components I use [ClarityUI](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/) version 0.13 and the API is [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2)
This is a simple project where the user can search for beers that contain an ingredient that the user writes.

## Install
Run `npm install` to get all node_modules installed to be able to run the project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` to run the project. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
